#A ray of light comes in from the upper left corner of an MxN sized window, with 45Ëš angled edges.
#The ray is reflected when it reaches the first or the last line, or the first or last column respectively.
#Display all the positions reached until the ray travels to a window corner.

#Input: M and N integers
#Output: matrix of MXN with the positions

#Example: 
#For M = 4 and N = 8 the reached positions are the following:
#The ray of light reaches the bottom right corner.
#Output for console should be the following:
#1,0,13,0,19,0,7,0
#0,2,0,12,0,6,0,8
#15,0,3,0,5,0,9,0
#0,16,0,4,0,10,0,22
